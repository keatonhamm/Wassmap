# Wassmap

**9/28/2022 Update:** This repository has moved to https://github.com/wassmap  
We will reflect it here as well, but for the most updated version, please see the repository above.

Code from the paper "Wassmap: Wasserstein Isometric Mapping for Image Manifold Learning" by Keaton Hamm, Nick Henscheid, and Shujie Kang. Available on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06645.pdf

**Main file:** Wasserstein.ipynb contains code and experiments from the paper with some exceptions. Figures 7 and 9, and the figure in the Supplemental Materia are based on a previous Matlab version of our code. While the substance is the same, we are no longer maintaining that set of code. We will port it to Python in due time.

More thorough readme coming soon, but there are many comments in the jupyter notebook to explain the code and give standard usage of functions therein.

**Last Updated** 28 September, 2022.
